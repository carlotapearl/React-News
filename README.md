There's a library for that! I'll recommend two, plus tell you what won't work." Note the two he recommends are: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) ~ [Stately](https://stately.ai/)

Comment by Gavin Thomas from Great State: "If you want those reducers to be more robust you need to [switch on state](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/#treat-reducers-as-state-machines) one thing about xstate is it treats side effects as a 1st class citizen. Redux doesn't"
